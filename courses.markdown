## Upcoming Fall 2021 Hungarian to English Literary Translation Course:

People interested in pursuing the art of literary translation as a hobby or as a potential career are encouraged to apply for this course. Only a love for     
  Hungarian literature and an advanced English proficiency are required for attendance. Students need not native speakers of either language. This course will cover 
  classical and contemporary authors, both household names and newly emerging talent. Translators should expect to work with Sándor Weöres, Csáth Géza, Ilka Papp 
  Zakor, Kornélia Deres, and Ferenc Molnár. A few of these authors are scheduled to make an appearance for the class to answer translation questions. Through our 
  reading and translation practice, we will explore questions of genre, form, meaning, faithfulness to the original text, artistic liberties, localization, and 
  more. Students should be prepared to translate a passage of prose, poetry, or drama each week and provide helpful feedback to their classmates. Finally, toward 
  the end of the course, I will provide students with the tools and knowledge necessary to publish their translations in English-language literary journals and with 
  publishing houses.

  <b> From February 16th to May 25th 2021, I had the pleasure of leading an online Hungarian to English literary translation workshop of five students. We gathered 
    on Zoom every Tuesday evening for an hour and a half from all across the globe—Budapest, Berlin, Paris, London, and Bloomington, Indiana. Together, we tackled a 
    carefully curated selection of texts from classical and contemporary, male and female Hungarian authors, including poets, dramatists, and fiction writers. We 
    discussed the nuances of both languages (like, does együttérzés translate as compassion or empathy? And what is the difference between the two?), compared the 
    intricacies of the two cultures (what an American or British sanatorium entails vs. a Hungarian one); and asked difficult questions (like, just what exactly is 
    in a gyros?). We also had the opportunity to pose our questions to some of the authors themselves, namely Lajos Parti Nagy, Panni Puskás, and Márton Simon. It 
    was a thrill and an absolute delight to have discussions like these with such sharp minds, and to guide the work of such skilled rising translators. I can 
    rightly claim to have learned as much over the course of these months as they did. At the end of our course, Hungarian Literature Online published a translation 
    of each student. Those works can be found here: 
  ["The Fat Girl Inside Me", a story by Panni Puskás, translated by Anna Polonyi](https://hlo.hu/new-work/panni-puskas-the-fat-girl-inside-me-1.html)
  ["Atlantis", a poem by Márton Simon, translated by Ryan Lane](https://hlo.hu/new-work/marton-simon-atlantis.html)
  [The second act of the play Atriumchloride by Lajos Parti Nagy, translated by Charles Hebbert](https://hlo.hu/new-work/lajos-parti-nagy-guest-house.html)
